# HISK_Market_Risk_Analyzer
The Market Risk Analyzer is designed to quantify and evaluate market risk conditions rather than predict price direction. It focuses on measuring uncertainty, downside exposure, regime behavior, trend stability, and optimal capital allocation to support risk-aware decision-making instead of a single buy and sell signal.
